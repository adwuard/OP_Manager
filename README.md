# OP-Manager
Common issues from the OP-1 users is that OP-1 doesn't support projects and the unit only allow certain amount of patches.
I am currently developing a compact hardware tool that can easily swap and backup all the user patches and projects. This unit can benifet for users who don't want to connect their OP-1 to their computer. Or performers who wants to switch patches, and projects on the go. And allows the user to store all their OP-1 files in one place and store as much patches as whatever the SD card's capacity is available. The device will be low cost and compact.

## Features
#### OP1 Patches/ Projects
* Backup Patches/ Project - Backup all the new patches/ project to local library   
* Upload Patches/Packs - Upload patches from local library. It can be singe patch or multiple  
* Rename Patch Name/ Projects - Be able to change name of the file
* Upload Project - Overwrite current project on the OP-1  
* Remain available slots check on OP1 

#### OPZ Project
* Freeze OPZ State - Backup OPZ entire instance including projects and samples
* Recall OPZ State - Recall OPZ entire instance including projects and samples
* Manage OPZ - Upload/Delete samples from existing OP1 Library   

#### MIDI HOST
* USB MIDI can now be hosted and transmit through standard 5 Pin Midi In Out port  

#### OP1.FUN Site
Be able to login and download packs to local library or OP1 directly.

#### Others
* SSH Wifi AP  
* Battery Level Indicator with MAX 17043 Chip  
* Other minor bug fixes
